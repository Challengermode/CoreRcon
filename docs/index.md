# CoreRCON

An example program for using CoreRCON can be found in [`Program.cs`](https://github.com/Challengermode/CoreRcon/blob/master/src/RconShell/Program.cs).

I highly recommend you check out the [Quick-Start Guide](https://github.com/ScottKaye/CoreRCON/blob/master/README.md), as this documentation kinda sucks.  Work in progress!
