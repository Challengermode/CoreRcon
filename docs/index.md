# CoreRCON

CoreRCON is an implementation of Valve's [Source RCON Protocol](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_RCON_Protocol) on .NET Core.  It currently supports connecting to a server, sending commands and receiving their output, and receiving logs from SRCDS' `logaddress` functionality.

An example program for using CoreRCON can be found in [`Program.cs`](https://github.com/ScottKaye/CoreRCON/blob/master/src/CoreRCON/Program.cs).
